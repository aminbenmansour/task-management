# task-management

This project was initially done for academic purposes

      The idea is to develop a task management algorithm. This idea is widely used in societies. It helps them adopt modern working methodologies to better 
manage the flow of activities of each project, mainly agile methodologies. Its most famous frameworks are SCRUM and Kanban. The algorithm to be implemented 
must make it possible to manage the tasks by assigning them a state for each of the deadlines and the employees who are responsible for its production, the team
members are able to make complaints in case of discovery of bugs for purpose to bypass any imperfection.

I will appreciate any contributions so i can enhance my abilities in C programming, thanks in advance
